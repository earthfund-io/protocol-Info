## EarthFund DAO
EarthFund is a DAO-controlled crowdfunding platform for projects and ideas that can build a better tomorrow. It was built to give everybody a meaningful voice in the shape of their future.

We're currently building a fundraising platform on the blockchain. Decentralized and autonomous, but with all the user-friendly features of Web2.0, EarthFund is a platform designed for mass adoption. 

Once live, Earthlings will be able to join communities for causes theyâ€™re passionate about, fundraise the money they need, and vote as a collective which world-changing projects get the funding they need to make a difference.

### Governance

Our governance is broken into 4 workstreams and a central group of nominated counselors who oversee the development of the platform. Within a year of launch, the council will be replaced by the community, ensuring EarthFund is fully autonomous.

Voting is handled off-chain by {Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/earthfundgovernance.eth). This ensures the results are verifiable and the voting process is tamper-resistant. (Votes and relayer receipts stored in IPFS). Once consensus has been reached, the result is then executed on-chain. 

Proposals are created within Snapshot and then put for a vote. Before that, we allow for discussion and soft consensus.
